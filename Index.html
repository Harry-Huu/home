	<h2> Anatomy </h2>
	<p> The brain is a complex organ composed 3 main parts; the cerebrum, cerebellum, 
	and the brain stem.  The cerebrum is the largest component of the brain, and divided 
	into two hemispheres, right and left.  The corpus callosum is the white fiber that 
	connects the hemispheres.  Each of the hemispheres is divided into 4 lobes: frontal, 
	parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe.

	The frontal lobe is distinguished from the parietal lobe posteriorly by the central sulcus 
	(see the image below). The frontal lobe and parietal lobes are divided inferiorly from the 
	temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus. The parietal lobe is distinguished from the occipital 
	lobe by the parieto-occipital sulcus on the medial surface.
