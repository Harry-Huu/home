	The Spinal Cord
	</h1>
	<h2>
	Anatomy
	</h2>
	<p>
	The spinal cord is the main transmitter for information from the brain to the nervous system.
	The spinal cord lies inside the spinal coloumn and originates from the brain stem to the fibrous 
	extension known as the filum terminale.  The spinal cord is about 43-45 cm in length depending
	on gender.  The spinal cord is proteted by three layers of meninges; dura mater, arachnoid mater,
	and pia mater.  The spinal cord is ellipitical, and mainly divided into 4 areas; Cervical, Thoraric,
	Lumbar, and Sacral.

	<h2>
	Segments
	</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> 8 cervical segments forming 8 pairs of cervical nerves </li>
	<li> 12 thoracic segments forming 12 pairs of thoracic nerves </li>
	<li> 5 lumbar segments forming 5 pairs of lumbar nerves </li>
	<li> 5 sacral segments forming 5 pairs of sacral nerves </li>
	<li> 1 coccygeal segment </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
	Repair
	</h2>
	<p>The spinal cord was earlier belived to be irreperable, as the slightest impact with neurons can cause immense
	pain and disabilities.  The spinal cord connects the body&rsquo;s nerve cells to the brain. Where these neurons
	connect with the spinal cord, they become motor roots or sensory roots.  In an injury, these roots get torn, and 
	connections between certain parts of the body are nil.  The method surgeons have created is cutting out the original 
	sensory cells from the root and planting the root deeper in the spinal cord, the dorsal horn; an area filled with 
	more sensory neurons that do not usually connect directly to sensory roots.  This is but a small step in repairing
	a spinal cord, but the only one we have currently.
